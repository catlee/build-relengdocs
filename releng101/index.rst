Releng 101
==========

What is this?
-------------

* a primer for understanding the Mozilla Release Engineering system. It strips down our infrastructure into bare essentials
* a series of 'walk-throughs' to help connect our concepts, technologies, environments, and src code
* provides stripped down snippets that represent real source from our repos.

What this is not
----------------

* documentation. We are moving with a strong emphasize to documenting our logic in the src itself. These are tutorials that can not be
  expressed in the code
* explanation of technologies we use. Each walk-through will explain how we use technologies but will point to :ref:`software` for overviews
* an in depth coverage of all our special edge cases, variants, conditions, and the like.

I hope this provides
--------------------

1. a life jacket for Mozilla Releng contributors and new-hires
2. a bridge between the abstract concepts and the physical code
3. confidence for exploring every dark corner of our releng universe

Releng in a Nutshell
--------------------

To get the ball rolling, below are a collection of materials that will help provide a Releng Overview

* `Release Engineering as a Force Multiplier`_ -- John O'Duinn's Keynote at ICSE 2013
* `Keep Calm and Ship It`_ -- Mozilla Releng through John Zeller's 2012 intern presentation
* `Mozilla's cloud and in-house continuous integration`_ -- Armen Zambrano's Releng Conf 2014 talk on recent cloud integration
* `Planet Releng`_ -- an aggregate of all Mozilla Releng's blog sites
